            <p>Welcome to my website!</p>
            <p>Here you can find my web development projects I have been working on to expand my skills and knowledge. I have been also gaining knowledge through self-study, Codebar, meet-ups and mentoring. I have particularly enjoyed the creative and design aspects of web development in my own projects so far.</p>
            <h3>Technologies</h3>
            <p>Whilst learning web development, to expand my knowledge and skills one of my projects, that I have focused on is producing the Green Living website (<a href="https://greenliving.earth/">https://greenliving.earth/</a>). This project has taken me into many technical areas and has a real purpose to help others in the Brighton area on their environmental journey. Through developing this site I have focused on producing a user friendly and intuitive experience. This has been achieved through a cohesive colour scheme to reflect the environmental ethos. The typography and white space of the site creates the perception of minimalism and professionalism.</p>
            <p>To make the experience of the Green Living website engaging I have concentrated on user interaction through the use of JavaScript. This ensures that the user can navigate quickly around the site. As a site that is used on the go it was important to create a responsive layout, for use on all mobile devices and browsers. The constraints of adapting the site for smaller screens required me to implement techniques such modifying font-sizes and toggling layers for the map and directory views. Whilst developing this I have also considered how people use touch-screen devices and how this needs to be reflected in the design. This is shown in aspects such as the ‘pinch and zoom’ function on the map, and scrolling through the list of places.</p> 
            <p>The technologies I have used so far for the Green Living site on the back-end are Python and Django with a Model View Controller (MVC) approach. The custom Content Management System (CMS) I built ensures that the site is easy to maintain and expand. This will allow me to further expand the website to other areas of the country, in time, and create an Android and iOS app using the Application Programming Interface (API). </p>
            <p>To further my knowledge I have recently been learning React to understand how to create more advanced user interfaces and as a frame to organise code, especially in larger projects. An example can be seen in my GitHub React Cookie To-do List, which I have also added as a Codepen so can be easily viewed. This project also allowed me to work on visual aesthetics.</p> 
            <h3>Design</h3>
            <p>As part of marketing for the site I have created social media accounts to engage users visually. Through working on both my Green Living social media and my recent Codepen Cookie To-do List this I have expanded my photo editing and graphic design skills, using both Inkscape and GNU Image Manipulation Program (equivalent to Illustrator/Sketch and Photoshop respectively).  An example of using these can be seen in my Green Living Eco Advent calendar on Instagram, whereby I sourced and edited stock photography in a cohesive style that compliment the website. Vector tools such as Inkscape have also been beneficial in my projects for drawing icons and logos so that they are scalable to any size, whether on high resolution screens or printed.</p>
            <p>Through my projects I have taken design inspiration from sites such as Dribbble and Behance to keep up-to-date with the latest design trends, as well as drawing ingenuity from experienced designers on user interface problems. Through each project I have carefully considered colour schemes and fonts, and have used Adobe Color and Google Fonts to explore how different combinations compliment one another.</p>
